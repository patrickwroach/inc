# Incounter

Prototype for a tabletop RPG aid to assist game masters in tracking character state and initiative order in encounters.  Design and development done collaboratively in our spare time.

  • Front end only so it’s easier to prototype new features. Browser local storage is used to save state, so the same browser must be used to continue an encounter still in progress.

  • Work in progress; using as an opportunity to learn React framework, Webpack, and newer JavaScript language features.
